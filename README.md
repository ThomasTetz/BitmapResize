# BitmapResize

This is a simple program used to resize bitmap images while maintaining sharp edges.

Currently it resizes a 32x32 bitmap image into a 128x128 bitmap image.

It was a helper file for a school project and could still be greatly improved.



# Usage

1. Export the bitmap image into hex.

2. gcc -Wall bitmap_resize.c -o resize

3. /resize original_hex new_hex

4. Import the hex file into a bitmap editor to recover the new image.
